This expansion would increase the U.S. geothermal capacity from 4 gigawatts to around 16 gigawatts, providing a cost-effective energy source compared to current prices. In areas with ample geothermal resources, such as the Western U.S., it could potentially fulfill 100% of new data center energy needs, thus helping to alleviate the anticipated power crunch as data center construction accelerates.",
