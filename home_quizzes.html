    "content": "Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes has expressed his disapproval of the impending automated strike zone in Major League Baseball, emphasizing his preference for the human element of the game. He argues that an automated system would undermine the role of catchers and the nuances of umpiring, stating that every game presents different strike zones based on the umpire's style. Skenes' sentiments echo those of fellow players, including Max Scherzer, who believe that current umpires perform well and question the necessity of such a significant change. The automated strike zone is expected to be implemented by the regular season of 2026, following trials in the minors and this year's spring training.",
