These newly discovered planets are too hot to support life as we know it, but their proximity to Earth makes Barnard's Star an interesting target for future exploration. Although there have been claims of exoplanets around this star since the 1960s, this confirmation solidifies understanding of the star system, which is about 6 light-years away from us.",

He highlights that sunlight can enhance sleep regulation, mood, and immune function, while also contributing to the production of vitamin D, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Seheult cautions against overexposure to sunlight leading to skin damage but encourages moderate exposure, suggesting that just 15 to 20 minutes in sunlight can significantly boost health. Recent studies support the idea that increased time outdoors may lower overall mortality rates, including from cancer.",
