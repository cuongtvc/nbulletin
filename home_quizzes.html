This advanced phishing kit acts as a middleman, capturing login details and one-time passwords from users as they attempt to log in to legitimate services. Unlike traditional phishing techniques that rely on fake login pages, Astaroth utilizes session hijacking to give attackers full access to user accounts without triggering security alerts.
