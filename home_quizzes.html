Researchers found that larger planets, particularly those with non-circular orbits, are more likely to develop in turbulent systems rich in metals like oxygen and iron. The study highlights a significant difference in the formation pathways of small and large planets, indicating that the orbits and sizes of planets are closely linked to their formation conditions.",

This region is filled with young stars and nebulae, where gas and dust interact to trigger new star formation. The images reveal how radiation from these hot, young stars shapes their surroundings, leading to the birth of new stars as portions of the gas clouds collapse. Scientists are studying these phenomena to better understand the dynamics of star formation in interacting galaxies.",
