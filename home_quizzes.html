The research found that stress-related neurotransmitters and hormones associated with obesity activate CREB, which promotes cancer cell growth in the pancreas. Specifically, female mice subjected to high-fat diets and stress showed a higher incidence of precancerous lesions. Experts suggest that lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising, and managing stress, could help reduce the risk of developing this deadly cancer.",

He highlights that sunlight can enhance sleep regulation, mood, and immune function, while also contributing to the production of vitamin D, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Seheult cautions against overexposure to sunlight leading to skin damage but encourages moderate exposure, suggesting that just 15 to 20 minutes in sunlight can significantly boost health. Recent studies support the idea that increased time outdoors may lower overall mortality rates, including from cancer.",
