However, human-induced climate change is likely to prevent this transition to a glacial state, as increased carbon dioxide emissions have altered the planet's natural climate trajectory. The study suggests that while natural climate cycles can be forecasted, the long-term impacts of human activities may override these cycles, making it improbable for the next ice age to occur as previously anticipated.",
