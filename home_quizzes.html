The study estimates that reductions in funding could lead to between 4.4 million to 10.8 million new infections and 770,000 to 2.9 million deaths in low- and middle-income countries. The U.S. has historically been the largest contributor to global HIV efforts, but funding cuts are jeopardizing decades of progress in combating the epidemic, particularly through critical programs like PEPFAR.",
