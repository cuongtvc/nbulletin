This model, he asserts, shares characteristics with Ponzi schemes, which rely on new investments to pay returns to older investors. Critics, particularly Democrats, have pushed back against Musk's statements, arguing they threaten the integrity and benefits of the program, but Agresti maintains that reform is necessary to ensure its sustainability.",
