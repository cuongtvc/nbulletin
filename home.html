This finding could help resolve debates about the formation timeline of Earth, as helium-3 is believed to have been present only for a short period during the planet's formation. Scientists found that helium can mix with iron under the extreme temperatures and pressures found in the core, allowing helium-3 to potentially remain locked there for billions of years. This insight could indicate that Earth formed more rapidly than previously thought, impacting our understanding of planetary formation.",
