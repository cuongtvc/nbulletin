According to Andrew Gillen from the Cato Institute, merely shifting oversight from the Department of Education to other government agencies will not significantly impact loan costs. He suggests that a fully private loan system would incentivize colleges to produce graduates capable of repaying their loans, addressing the current issues of student debt and college financing more effectively. The administration's recent proposals include transferring federal student loans to the Treasury or the Small Business Administration, but without systemic changes, these moves may not yield the desired results.",
