Located 218 light-years away, TOI-512b is larger and denser than Earth, orbiting its star closely and receiving intense heat. The research suggests that stellar radiation may have stripped away its gaseous envelope, although a process called core-powered mass loss could also explain its current state. This discovery adds to the understanding of exoplanet formation and evolution, highlighting the need for more examples to confirm these theories.",
