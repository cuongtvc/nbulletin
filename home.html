This legislation allows defendants to present evidence of intellectual disability during a pretrial hearing, which is a significant change from the state's previous requirement of proving intellectual disability beyond a reasonable doubt. The bill is a response to past cases where individuals with low IQs were executed, and it seeks to protect those who cannot defend themselves. The proposed changes now move to the Senate for consideration.",
