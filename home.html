From space, this event will be captured by satellites, revealing a dark shadow cast by the moon's penumbra over the Atlantic Ocean. While observers on the ground will see a significant portion of the sun obscured, satellites will document the eclipse's shadow blending with the night side of Earth. This phenomenon is characterized by the moon's penumbral shadow, which is lighter compared to the umbra that causes total solar eclipses.",

Critics, particularly Democrats, have pushed back against Musk's statements, arguing they threaten the integrity and benefits of the program, but Agresti maintains that reform is necessary to ensure its sustainability.",
