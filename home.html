His execution is set to take place unless there is a last-minute intervention from the governor or the Supreme Court, and it will be witnessed by select individuals from behind bullet-resistant glass. The firing squad execution has been characterized by some as a more humane option compared to other methods of execution.",

    "content": "Measles can have a long-term impact on immunity, a phenomenon known as \"immune amnesia,\" which was explained by Dr. Céline Gounder on CBS Mornings. This condition arises when the measles virus infects immune cells, damaging them and reducing the immune system's memory against other infections, making individuals more susceptible even after recovery. Studies indicate that the effects of immune amnesia can last from a few months to a couple of years, which can significantly affect children's health by increasing the risk of subsequent infections. Vaccination with the MMR vaccine is the best defense against measles and its lasting immune effects.",

This move comes after the Jaguars considered releasing Kirk, who missed the last nine games of the 2024 season due to a broken collarbone. The trade helps Jacksonville save $10.7 million against their salary cap while also gaining a draft pick, as Kirk had the highest cap hit on the team this season at $24.4 million. For the Texans, acquiring Kirk makes sense as they look to bolster their receiving corps following injuries to key players.",
