A jury concluded that Javice had significantly inflated the customer count of Frank, misleading JPMorgan into believing the startup had 4 million users when it actually had only about 300,000. The decision came after a five-week trial, where evidence suggested that she fabricated customer data with the help of a math professor. Javice, who maintains her innocence, faces a potential prison sentence of decades, with sentencing scheduled for August 2025.",
