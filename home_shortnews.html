Experts suggest that lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising, and managing stress, could help reduce the risk of developing this deadly cancer.",

He argued that this new regime, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa and associated with Islamist forces, is no better than the ousted Bashar al-Assad. Al-Assad warned that the new constitution, establishing Islamist rule for at least five years, poses significant risks to religious and ethnic minorities in Syria, who are already facing violent reprisals. He called for international support to establish a genuine democracy in Syria rather than funding a regime he claims is engaged in sectarian violence.",
