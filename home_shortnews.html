National Park Service spokesperson Mike Litterst advises visitors to use the Metro instead of driving due to heavy crowds and traffic. He emphasizes the importance of packing patience, as navigating the area can be slow, especially during peak bloom season which coincides with various events in the city. The cherry blossoms, gifted from Japan in 1912, typically last for about four weeks, attracting around 1.5 million visitors each year during the National Cherry Blossom Festival.",
