However, just 18 seconds after liftoff, the rocket experienced an anomaly, causing it to tumble and crash back to Earth, resulting in an explosion. No payloads were aboard this test flight, which aimed to gather data on the rocket's performance. The cause of the anomaly remains unclear, but the launch facility was reportedly unharmed, and Isar Aerospace has future missions planned despite this setback.",
