Dated between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the fossilized remains include an upper jawbone and partial cheekbone. This finding suggests early humans migrated to Western Europe much earlier than previously thought, potentially bridging the gap between earlier species like Homo georgicus and Homo antecessor. The study indicates that Pink may represent a new species, Homo 'affinis' erectus, and provides insights into the living conditions of early humans in a humid forest environment.",
