The eclipse, which cast darkness over Egypt, coincided with changes in solar worship, as Shepsekaf's tomb and name lacked traditional solar references. This eclipse's path of totality aligns with Shepsekaf's burial site, suggesting a potential connection between the celestial event and the decline of the solar cult in that era. The study highlights the broader implications of astronomical events on cultural and religious practices in ancient civilizations.",
