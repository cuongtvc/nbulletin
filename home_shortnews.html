    "content": "Maxar Intelligence has introduced a new drone technology called Raptor, which enables drones to navigate and identify ground coordinates even in areas where GPS signals are jammed or unavailable. This innovation arose from the challenges faced during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, where both sides effectively disrupted each other's GPS capabilities. Raptor utilizes a 3D mapping system combined with the drone's camera feed, allowing for precise navigation and positioning without reliance on satellite signals. Maxar aims to apply this technology for both military and commercial purposes, addressing the growing need for alternatives to conventional GPS systems.",
