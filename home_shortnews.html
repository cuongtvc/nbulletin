However, once funds from these accounts are withdrawn and deposited into other accounts, they may become accessible to creditors if a court judgment is obtained. Additionally, certain debts, such as those owed to the IRS or for child support, can lead to garnishment of retirement funds, highlighting the need for individuals to understand their rights and options regarding debt management.",
