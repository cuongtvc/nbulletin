While some scientists advocate that DMS could indicate biological processes, others express skepticism about the reliability of the findings, citing low statistical confidence and alternative explanations for the molecule's presence. Recent research indicates that DMS may not necessarily be a biosignature, as it can be produced through non-biological processes, complicating the search for extraterrestrial life.",

While \"Moon\" focuses on the isolated experience of a lunar technician dealing with his own clone, \"Mickey 17\" takes a comedic approach to a group mission in space with a more advanced clone. Both films explore the ethical implications of cloning and the societal issues that arise when duplicates confront one another, yet they diverge significantly in tone and execution.",
