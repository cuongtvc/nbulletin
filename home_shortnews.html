    "content": "Syrian human rights activist Ribal al-Assad criticized Europe for lifting sanctions on Syria's new interim government, which he labeled a 'terrorist' regime. He argued that this new regime, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa and associated with Islamist forces, is no better than the ousted Bashar al-Assad. Al-Assad warned that the new constitution, establishing Islamist rule for at least five years, poses significant risks to religious and ethnic minorities in Syria, who are already facing violent reprisals. He called for international support to establish a genuine democracy in Syria rather than funding a regime he claims is engaged in sectarian violence.",
