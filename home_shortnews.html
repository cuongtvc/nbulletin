    "content": "A new blood test has been developed that not only diagnoses Alzheimer's disease but also measures its progression by analyzing levels of the tau protein associated with dementia. Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine and Lund University found that the levels of MTBR-tau243 in blood samples correlate with tau accumulation in the brain, showing a 92% accuracy compared to brain scans. This test offers a simpler and more accessible method for staging Alzheimer's, potentially leading to personalized treatment options for patients.",
