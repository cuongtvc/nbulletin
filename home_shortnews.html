Traditional long-term care insurance is a standalone policy that covers a range of healthcare services but operates on a 'use-it-or-lose-it' basis, potentially leading to increased premiums over time. In contrast, hybrid long-term care policies combine life insurance with long-term care benefits, providing a death benefit if care services are not utilized, but typically at a higher cost. Experts suggest that the choice between the two depends on individual circumstances such as budget, health status, and the desire for specific coverage options.",
