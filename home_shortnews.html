    "content": "Spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, are known to have complex structures called 'feathers', which are regions of intense star formation. Recent research suggests that these feathers may form simply through the influence of gravity, rather than through more complex mechanisms like supernovae or magnetic fields. By simulating a rotating disk of gas without any additional forces, astronomers were able to observe the natural formation of feathers, indicating that gravity alone can create these intricate structures.",

This new theory posits that microlightning from water sprays may have been more effective than traditional lightning strikes in facilitating these essential reactions.",
